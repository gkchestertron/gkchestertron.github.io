      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting over is never easy&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do it a few times. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the few things in life that actually gets harder each time you do it. From school to my first failed career in church music, to my short-lived career in commercial photography, to a total reboot into tech as a front-end engineer, to back-end engineer, to managing engineers, to managing managers - some were harder than others to be sure, but with each successive revolution the cognitive load hit me harder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
