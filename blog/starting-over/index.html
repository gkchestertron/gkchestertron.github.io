        <p><strong>Starting over is never easy.</strong> I&rsquo;ve had to do it a few times. It&rsquo;s one of the few things in life that actually gets harder each time you do it. From school to my first failed career in church music, to my short-lived career in commercial photography, to a total reboot into tech as a front-end engineer, to backend engineer, to managing engineers, to managing managers - some were harder than others to be sure, but with each successive revolution the cognitive load hit me harder.</p>
<p>Despite my ostensible continued growth, <strong>I managed to remain set in at least some of my ways</strong>. I still primarily work in VIM when I still code, and I have mostly resisted the AI revolution so far. I read the blog posts and tried out a few models, and even wrote a <a href="https://github.com/gkchestertron/LLVIM">VIM plugin</a> so I could get a little AI flavor in my normal workflow. <strong>But, I wasn&rsquo;t really excited about it</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Until I played with MCP</strong>.</p>
