chess
=====
This was my first attempt at chess. It is a cli chess game that uses unicode characters for all the pieces and a two-dimensional array to store the state of the game. Much of the game logic is predicated on testing possible moves on a cloned version of the current state of the board. It does not implement En passant or castling. It is however colorized.
